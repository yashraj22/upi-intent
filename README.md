# React Native Expo Project

This is a React Native project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), created using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will start the Metro bundler and provide options to run the app on various platforms.

3. **Run the app**

   Choose one of the following options:
   - Press `a` to run on an Android emulator or connected device
   - Press `i` to run on an iOS simulator (macOS only)
   - Scan the QR code with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your mobile device

## Project Structure
